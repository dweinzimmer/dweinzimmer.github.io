This is the repository for my personal website, which uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/). I used to be in Wordpress, but decided to migrate my content over to this repo and host on Github Pages to have more control over my website, much better performance, and free hosting! 

I read a few blog posts/guides ([0](https://benjamintravis.com/blog/jekyll-github-pages-from-wordpress), [1](https://www.roberthorvick.com/blog/migrating-from-wordpress-to-jekyll-github-pages), [2](https://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/), [3](https://blog.jakelee.co.uk/why-i-moved-from-wordpress-to-jekyll/)) about migrating from Wordpress to Jekyll that were helpful. GitHub has great instructions on [creating a GitHub Pages with Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll), [publishing from a branch](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#publishing-from-a-branch) which is how I deploy this website, and [using a custom domain with a GitHub Pages site](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site).

I am using the [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) Jekyll theme.
