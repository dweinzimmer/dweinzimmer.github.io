I was born and raised in the East Bay and lived in the Bay Area for most of my life, so I‚Äôm switching up my travel recommendations to give some highlights of my favorite places from home!

# EAST BAY (Berkeley, Oakland)

## Food & Drink

- **Shan Dong** ü•¢ ([site](http://www.shandongoakland.com/); [map](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Shandong+Restaurant/@37.800673,-122.272084,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x808f80b5c6d4610d:0x410ae1ade597863f!8m2!3d37.800673!4d-122.26989)) in Downtown Oakland is the definition of home. This is my favorite restaurant in America. They are known for their hand-pulled noodles, so whatever you get with noodles, make sure to pay the $1 extra for hand-pulled. (You should get the **sesame noodles**.) This place is very popular, so if you come at 6pm on a Friday you will probably have a long wait for a table.
- **East Ocean Seafood** ü•¢ ([site](http://eastoceanseafoodrestaurant.com/); [map](https://www.google.com/maps/place/East+Ocean+Seafood+Restaurant/@37.7766902,-122.2768407,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xeb68a2c2e860aad0?sa=X)) in Alameda, or more easily transit-accessible, **Peony Seafood Restaurant** ü•¢ ([site](https://peonyrestaurant.com/); [map](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Peony+Seafood+Restaurant/@37.8006847,-122.27327,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x808f80b67f1b9b13:0x435fb848a7a0b938!8m2!3d37.8006847!4d-122.271076)) are both very, very good for dim sum.
- **Cheeseboard Pizza** üçï ([site](http://cheeseboardcollective.coop/pizza/); [map](https://www.google.com/maps/place/The+Cheeseboard+Pizza/@37.8798723,-122.2716734,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x80857ea1344c98af:0x314b749bfb2469c6!8m2!3d37.8798723!4d-122.2694794)) (A pre-emptive ‚Äúcalm down!‚Äù to the New Yorkers out there. It‚Äôs not deep dish, and it‚Äôs not New York, and that‚Äôs ok.) Cheeseboard does only one type of pizza per day, and it‚Äôs always vegetarian, and very good. Check the website in advance to see the flavor that day. Closed on Sundays & Mondays, which is always when you‚Äôll want it.
- **Zachary‚Äôs Pizza** üçï ([site](http://www.zacharys.com/); [map](https://www.google.com/maps/search/zachary's+pizza/@37.8628981,-122.3636477,11z)) is the deep dish pizza of my childhood. This is the pizza we pick up on the way back home from the Cal Bears losing the football game.
- **Taqueria Sinaloa** üåÆ ([site](https://www.yelp.com/biz/taqueria-sinaloa-oakland-2); [map](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Taqueria+Sinaloa/@37.7849461,-122.2401683,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x80857e2eef515321:0xd4ea727fb6f527b8!8m2!3d37.7849461!4d-122.2379743)) is my favorite taco truck. There‚Äôs also a location now on Telegraph Avenue near campus in Berkeley, but the original truck in Oakland is the full experience.
- **Comal** üç∏üåÆ ([site](http://www.comalberkeley.com/); [map](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Comal/@37.8715656,-122.2686303,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x5b6e97d44d0b2925!8m2!3d37.8715656!4d-122.2686303)) in Downtown Berkeley is a beautiful place to grab a drink at the bar in the back and sit outside. If you can manage to get a table, the food is excellent as well!
- **Mezzo** ü•ó ([site](https://www.mezzo-berkeley.com/); [map](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Cafe+Mezzo/@37.8661469,-122.2587495,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x79ef9933388fbd01?sa=X)) is the reincarnation of Caf√© Intermezzo, which burned down while I was in undergrad. The **Veggie Delight** (with poppy seed dressing) is the main attraction here, and it is so, so good. Count on splitting this salad between two people. It is attached to **Raleigh's Pub**, and the new space has a beautiful outdoor area in the back, so you can enjoy a beer with your salad if you'd like!
- **Vik's Chaat Corner** üçõüå∂ ([site](http://vikschaat.com/); [map](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Viks+Chaat/@37.8600659,-122.2983105,15z/data=!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x0:0x5ab50da0a7efc299!2sThe+Rare+Barrel!8m2!3d37.8577958!4d-122.291487!3m4!1s0x80857ee873ccbc7d:0x155df5665e04771b!8m2!3d37.8613909!4d-122.2980639)) in West Berkeley is an great place to try chaat, Indian street snacks. My favorites are *[bhel puri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhelpuri)* and *![cholle bhature](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Chole_Bhature_from_Nagpur.JPG)*. This is right by the Bay Trail!
- **Caff√® Strada** ‚òï ([site](https://www.facebook.com/Caffe-Strada-Berkeley-132397263447164/); [map](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Caffe+Strada/@37.869133,-122.2547647,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x43f6bea2790d5d28?sa=X)) ‚Äî sit outside on a warm afternoon, watching the setting sun turning campus and the hills a golden color, and pretend you‚Äôre procrastinating on putting together your annotated bibliography.
- **Cole Coffee** ‚òïüç© (site; map) is my favorite coffee shop in my old neighborhood. You can choose from over a dozen roasts of coffee ‚Äî I love the Peruvian and the Mexican. If you‚Äôre lucky, one of the Donut Farm (formerly Pepple‚Äôs Farm) vegan blueberry donuts will be there! (If not, you can check across the street at **Philz** or go to **[Donut Farm](https://www.vegandonut.farm/)**‚Äôs main [location](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Donut+Farm+Oakland/@37.8436424,-122.2863702,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x80857e6643fc8eb3:0x381d74a3b12c2d0c!8m2!3d37.8436424!4d-122.2841762)). One block up from Cole Cofffee, check out **La Farine Bakery**, or **Southie** if you want a casual but delicious sandwich.
- **Cafe Colucci** üá™üáπ ([site](https://www.cafecolucci.com/); [map](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Caf%C3%A9+Colucci/@37.85076,-122.2607373,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xeef404a132c138b8?sa=X)) is my favorite Ethiopian food in the Bay! Get the veggie combo (seriously) plus whatever else looks good to you.
- **Fenton‚Äôs Creamery** üç® ([site](https://www.fentonscreamery.com/); [map](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Fentons+Creamery/@37.827937,-122.2523827,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x80857df6c43cdebb:0x91f2ea4405beec30!8m2!3d37.827937!4d-122.250194)) is a classic ice cream parlor. You may have seen a shout-out to it from Pixar in Up!
- **Rare Barrel** üç∫ ([site](https://www.therarebarrel.com/); [map](https://www.google.com/maps/place/The+Rare+Barrel/@37.8577958,-122.291487,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x5ab50da0a7efc299?sa=X)) is an awesome brewery to try a bunch of sour beers!
- **Thai Temple (Wat Mongkolratanaram)** üçõ ([site](https://www.yelp.com/biz/wat-mongkolratanaram-berkeley); [map](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Wat+Mongkolratanaram/@37.8564077,-122.2707219,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xe309caa1b5710fc0!8m2!3d37.8564077!4d-122.2707219)) is a Sundays-only food event (as of current writing, 10am-1pm)! Here‚Äôs a good [article](https://www.kqed.org/bayareabites/108531/wat-mongkolratanaram-berkeleys-thai-temple-celebrates-the-new-year) about it. It‚Äôs vegetarian-friendly, and everything is delicious. Don‚Äôt miss the delicious mango sticky rice and the *kanom krok* coconut-rice pancakes!

The Oakland-Grand Lake Farmer‚Äôs Market ([site](http://www.marinfarmersmarkets.org/); [map](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Oakland-Grand+Lake+Farmers+Market/@37.8108359,-122.2500114,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x808f8743f0967b43:0xf7d09cf6ee042970!8m2!3d37.8108359!4d-122.2478174)) on Saturdays is one of the very best in the Bay.

If you‚Äôre traveling with children, make sure to visit the [steam trains](https://redwood-valley-railway.business.site/)!

# SAN FRANCISCO

## Food & Drink

There are so many good options in San Francisco, and Yelp/Foursquare will guide you well, but these are some of my favorites.

- **Arizmendi Bakery** üçûüçï ([site](http://arizmendi-valencia.squarespace.com/); [map](https://www.google.com/maps/search/arizmendi+bakery/@37.7927884,-122.4256801,12z/data=!3m1!4b1)) single-handedly made me gain 15 pounds. Every location of this co-op bakery is slightly different ‚Äî my favorite is the location at Valencia & 24th in the Mission. Get the X-roll (sourdough cheese roll with the vegetables of the day in it) or the Chocolate Thing (chocolate brioche), or whatever looks good to you. The [always vegetarian] pizza of the day is always good too.
- **The Mill** üçûüçï ([site](http://www.themillsf.com/); [map](https://www.google.com/maps/place/The+Mill/@37.776466,-122.4400211,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x808580b02db73457:0x185a61a92a363ce8!8m2!3d37.776466!4d-122.4378324)) The Bay Area clearly has a lot of places that are good at pizza and breads. The parmesan pepper roll is my favorite here, and the [always vegetarian] pizza of the day. This is also the home of the famous ‚Äú$4 toast,‚Äù though it costs more than $4 now.
- **Souvla** ü•óüç∑ ([site](https://www.souvla.com/); [map](https://www.google.com/maps/search/souvla/@37.7695116,-122.4372746,14z?entry=ttu)) is a Greek restaurant with three locations (Hayes Valley, Western Addition/NoPa, and Mission) and a simple but great menu. Choose your protein, and choose whether you want it as a wrap or salad. Get it ‚ÄúGreek style‚Äù (fries on top!). The ros√© is great, too.
- **Taqueria San Jose** üåÆ ([site](http://www.taqueriasanjosesf.com/); [map](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Taqueria+San+Jose/@37.7517432,-122.4186623,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x6f61fcafc41d5a42?sa=X)) is one of the many great places for tacos in then Mission. **La Taqueria** üåÆüåØ ([site](https://www.facebook.com/LaTaqSF/); [map](https://www.google.com/maps/place/La+Taqueria/@37.7508961,-122.4180867,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x21fce96ce541e475!8m2!3d37.7508961!4d-122.4180867)) just down the street has been awarded ‚Äúbest burrito‚Äù many times, and **Papalote** üåØ ([site](http://www.papalote-sf.com/); [map](https://www.google.com/maps/search/papalote/@37.7517377,-122.4449271,13z/data=!3m1!4b1)) nearby is also great, and their salsa is crazy good!
- **Nopalito** üåÆ ([site](http://www.nopalitosf.com/); [map](https://www.google.com/maps/search/nopalito/@37.7659189,-122.4714982,13z)) is a sit-down restaurant that has a really creative menu of Mexican dishes, and is so delicious. You can call ahead to place your name on the waitlist for a table.
- **Good Luck Dim Sum** ü•ü ([site](https://goodluckdimsum.site/); [map](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Good+Luck+Dim+Sum/@37.7829939,-122.4672055,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x8085873db011605d:0x6c99e23f7154f2a5!8m2!3d37.7829939!4d-122.4672055!16s%2Fg%2F1thqb289?entry=ttu)) is my favorite dim sum to go place. You will be full for $5.
- **Sichuan Home** ü•¢üå∂ ([site](http://www.sichuanhomesf.com/); [map](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sichuan+Home/@37.7804054,-122.4758358,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x80858716ea9898f7:0x1198dc155fbeab4!8m2!3d37.7804054!4d-122.4736471)) is delicious for spicy Sichuanese food.
- **Little Star Pizza** üçï ([site](https://www.littlestarpizza.com/); [map](https://www.google.com/maps/search/little+star+pizza/@37.8119351,-122.4845586,11z/data=!3m1!4b1)) is my favorite of the deep dish pizzas in San Francisco, and the rest of their menu is good, too. They‚Äôve got multiple locations, including one in the East Bay in Albany!

## Activities

- **The Ferry Building** ([map](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Ferry+Building,+One+San+Francisco+Bay+Trail,+San+Francisco,+CA+94111/@37.7955703,-122.3955095,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x808580668cd055bb:0x9cbbc099ec82aef7!8m2!3d37.7955703!4d-122.3933208)) is popular with both tourists and San Franciscans. There are so many great food vendors here, and there‚Äôs a [farmer‚Äôs market](https://www.ferrybuildingmarketplace.com/farmers-market/) a few days a week.
- **Parks** üå≥ ([site](http://sfrecpark.org/parks-open-spaces/); [list](https://www.thrillist.com/lifestyle/san-francisco/san-franciscos-top-parks-ranked)) There are so many beautiful parks in San Francisco!  As a short list, check out **Golden Gate Park** which is enormous and has the De Young Museum, California Academy of Science, Conservatory of Flowers, Botanical Gardens, Stow Lake, and Dutch Windmills, among many other sights to see. Hike to the top of **Buena Vista Park** when you are visiting the Haight! And go to **Alamo Square** for the classic view of the Full House house. Hang out at **Mission Dolores Park** with seemingly every young person in the city on a sunny weekend afternoon.
- **The Mission** is a great neighborhood to wander around, especially up and down [24th Street](https://www.google.com/maps/place/24th+St,+San+Francisco,+CA/@37.7525417,-122.4157305,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x808f7e47cd402a13:0x7a8d45e69d7943a6!8m2!3d37.7525417!4d-122.4135418), and up and down [Valencia](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Valencia+St,+San+Francisco,+CA/@37.7590112,-122.4235332,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x808f7e3c4d2e22ed:0x99cfd636890e9deb!8m2!3d37.7590112!4d-122.4213445).
- **The Castro** üåà is just a short walk west of the Mission.

My favorite bar to sit, relax, and look out the windows is **Twin Peaks Tavern** ([site](http://www.twinpeakstavern.com/home.html); [map](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Twin+Peaks+Tavern/@37.7624034,-122.4371533,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x808580a7e0b6e17b:0x1a931ba5fb37f5d!8m2!3d37.7624034!4d-122.4349646)) at the corner of Castro and 17th/Market.

You will learn a lot and have fun! It‚Äôs also on the Embarcadero in SF, so at the end of the day you‚Äôll have a good view of the [Bay Lights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bay_Lights) display on the Bay Bridge (if they turn those back on...).

You can also go a bit further down the coast and explore **Big Sur**.

**Wine Country** is also great! I love visiting wineries in Sonoma County in general, and also particularly along the Gravenstein Highway in Sebastopol, or near Healdsburg along Dry Creek Road and Alexander Valley stretching toward Napa Valley. Stop in **Healdsburg** on your way for lots of great restaurants and coffee from **Flying Goat** ([map](https://www.google.com/maps/search/flying+goat/@38.6107679,-122.8712108,17z/data=!3m1!4b1?entry=ttu)).

Just beware there can be a very long line!
