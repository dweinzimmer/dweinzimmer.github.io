Over the years, I've spent a fair amount of time in LA, though less so recently. Here are some of the places I love to eat, organized geographically. It is incredibly incomplete.

# Central

- [**El Compadre**](https://www.google.com/maps/place/El+Compadre/@34.0922932,-118.355484,14.91z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x80c2bedc1d182345:0x6ca7a9720ad4bcfc!8m2!3d34.0977881!4d-118.3522356!16s%2Fg%2F1tcww_7f?entry=ttu) is a classic California Mexican restaurant with enormous margaritas and a lot of ambiance.
- [**Bhan Khanom Thai**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rrbifxGs6yqS1dbq9) is a really great Thai dessert shop. Great mango sticky rice, but a lot more than that! It's in Thai Town, so definitely grab a meal somewhere near by too.
- [**Guelaguetza Restaurant**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Uf1Tc4CoqNj9JvoN7) is so cool! An enormous Oaxacan restaurant in K-Town with a huge menu, and sometimes live music.
- [**Park's BBQ**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/uANFYhkCdLFAWads9) is a good choice for Korean BBQ in K-Town!
- [**daybird**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/DL5FJGyx7SsBSgLr8) has dreamy Szechuan hot chicken sandwiches, and at the time I'm writing this they've got a fish sandwich on the menu, too. Maybe verify on their [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/daybirdla/).
- [**Pine and Crane**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mmqNGBjpR82SanNz5) is a great counter-service Taiwanese restaurant in Silverlake on the Sunset Triangle Plaza on Sunset Boulevard. It's wonderful to order a few small plates at the counter and enjoy them outside! Don't sleep on the vegetable dishes. Afterward, maybe wander a few blocks over to the beautiful [**Intelligentsia Coffee**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hZSHgQPy8yKBcjL57) location.

- [**Guisados**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PmQedXZEN8SoQEwx7) in Echo Park is one of my favorite taco spots anywhere. The name means "stews" and their stewed meats/seafoods are what they're famous for, but everything is so good (including the Dodgers-blue horchata). It's just a bit off the main stretch of Echo Park on Sunset Boulevard, which I love. Some of the more central restaurants I really liked have closed, but there are others I haven't been to yet that I've got my eye on. [**Button Mash**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hZSHgQPy8yKBcjL57) is a unique spot for food, drinks/beers, and vintage arcade games.

# Downtown and East Side

- [**Tacos 1986**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4fLTuFdNGtiBxLme6) has truly incredible Tijuana-style tacos. When I had a choice for one stop for lunch while passing through LA a couple years ago, this is what I chose.
- [**Sonoratown**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/N9eekv9pSrzcnWsQ7) is repping Sonora, famous for its flour tortillas and beef, both well represented on the menu. They're also vegetarian-friendly (though that will have to be corn tortillas).
- [**Grand Central Market**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/r6xggFaZe9vfLMWq5) is a lot of fun to wander around, with its dozens of food vendors. [**Sarita's Pupuseria**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/auAxMKE8okX27xTeA) is one of my favorites. A huge food hall in a historic building, and a nice corner of old downtown to appreciate the neighborhood's architectural beauty.
- [**Tacos y Birria La Unica**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/aXNtxhawfXQoYk5L7) and [**Mariscos Jalisco**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/aXNtxhawfXQoYk5L7) are two amazing taco/seafood trucks on East Olympic Boulevard in East LA. Both no frills and top notch.

# The Valley

- [**Porto's Bakery and Cafe**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4FdCRj98YhgRm5Ap9) in Burbank is a Cuban bakery and institution, most famous for its guava cheese rolls.
- [**Brent's Deli**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6BNpifrN4ZnbT5ng8) in Northridge is one of my favorite Jewish delis.
