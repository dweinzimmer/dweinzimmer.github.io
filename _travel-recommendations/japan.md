I spent almost a month in Japan in spring 2024 (and was lucky to catch cherry blossom season since it came almost two weeks late!). Here are some of my highlights.

# General thoughts

## Apps

Pack yourself a large external battery, because your phone will really help you out in Japan. Transit and many other signs are always in both English and Japanese, but aside from that there are often significant language barriers, even in major cities like Tokyo and Osaka.

**Google Maps** works great for navigating, and generally has perfectly accurate transit directions everywhere I tried it (correct timetables, routes, and often even platform numbers for municipal and national trains!).

**Google Translate** is also incredibly helpful. Download offline Japanese capability. Note that you can translate photos! Either point the in-app camera directly at Japanese (or any) text and it will translate it; or I found that sometimes, especially with small print, it worked better to take a photo on my phone's camera and then upload the image to Google Translate from my photo library. I may or may not have had many successful conversations back and forth in a Japanese hospital via Google Translate...

[**Visit Japan Web**](https://services.digital.go.jp/en/visit-japan-web/) was helpful both for filling out the immigration forms to generate a QR code that made it slightly quicker to get through immigration upon arrival; and also for generating a Tax Free Shopping QR code that some businesses accepted (others required seeing your passport, and a photocopy of it won't work, so generally I found it helpful to carry my passport with me every day unlike in most of my travels). You can follow [these instructions](https://www.vjw.digital.go.jp/manual/offline/visitjapanweb_manual_offline_en.html) to put the website on your homescreen so it looks like an app.

## Rail transportation

### IC Cards

IC cards are transit tap cards. You can use them on many Japan Rail (JR) trains and local transit within major cities; but you can also use them at convenience stores, vending machines, and anywhere you see the IC symbol.

If you have an iPhone, you can get an IC card in your phone Wallet right now! Click on the + sign in the Wallet app, add a "Transit Card", and in the Japan section choose whichever of the options (currently ICOCA, PASMO, or Suica) you think is cutest. They all work the same and are equally interoperable with all IC card networks across the country. For Android users, at least as of now (June 2024) you will have to get a physical IC card instead. I spent a while trying to research if there was any con to having a digital IC card on my phone, and couldn't find a definitive answer online, but: the answer is no. It works just as well, and you can do everything you'd do with a physical card (such as link shinkansen reservations); but you also have the distinct benefit of easily being able to reload the card right on your phone at any time in any amount.

As of June 2024, many Visa cards (including mine from Chase) did not work for reloading IC cards from the Apple Wallet app, though American Express worked perfectly. You can buy your IC card before you leave home and try adding a small amount to it like 500¬• so you can figure out what credit card will work for you; you may need to add a different one to your phone's wallet.
{: .notice--info}

If you have a digital IC card, whichever one you choose will have a difficult-to-use, Japanese-only iPhone app that you can use to grab your IC card number (why it's not just on the IC card info in Apple Wallet, I don't know...). Use Google Translate if you need to to navigate the corresponding app and figure it out, so you can attach your shinkansen (high speed rail) tickets to your phone and effortlessly tap through the shinkansen turnstiles.

### Rail passes

You'll see a lot of things from pre-2023 encouraging getting a [Japan Rail Pass](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2361.html). Prices increased by about 70% in October 2023, so I used the [Japan Rail Pass Calculator](https://www.japan-guide.com/railpass/) to figure out that it was not a good deal for me. You have to cover a lot of mileage very quickly for it to be a good deal. There are however also a number of [regional rail passes](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2357.html) that might make sense for you. For example, the [Sapporo-Noboribetsu Area Pass](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2361_noboribetsu.html) worked great for me and saved me a little bit of money.

### Reserving trains

If you have a rail pass, it will have a protocol for how you can reserve tickets through it (I was able to prebook trips with my Sapporo-Noboribetsu Area pass through their website).

PLACEHOLDER you can reserve for groups... talk about both apps. Like I mentioned in the [IC cards section above](#ic-cards), ....get your number so you can tap in.

## Itineraries

Japan is a huge country with too many wonderful places to visit, even for me having almost a month! It seems like everyone goes to Tokyo, Kyoto, and Osaka; I did start with that, and it was wonderful! With my additional time I went to Hokkaido (to Sapporo, the largest city, and Noboribetsu Onsen, a nearby onsen town), Hiroshima, and Kinosaki Onsen (another onsen town, on the Sea of Japan northwest of Kyoto). I loved everywhere I went, but Hiroshima was really a standout for me.

There are so many other places I wish I could have gone and would like to go on [future trips](#places-for-future-trips)!

## Onsens

Onsens (hot springs) are a big deal in Japan, and they are wonderful! If you're not familiar with the etiquette, [read up a bit before you go](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2292_how.html). There are onsens in many ryokan (traditional inns) in major cities, or a bunch of beautiful onsen towns across Japan -- I visited both [Kinosaki Onsen](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3525.html) and [Noboribetsu Onsen](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e6752.html) and they were both quite different and wonderful.

# Tokyo üóº

I stayed in a few different places in Tokyo... Shimbashi (at the [1899 Hotel](https://www.google.com/maps/place/1899+Hotel/@35.6624252,139.7489498,17z/data=!3m2!4b1!5s0x60188bc0229a1fbd:0x2da516cee522bbb0!4m9!3m8!1s0x60188bc02226b81b:0x7fb504bccc34f7dd!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d35.6624209!4d139.7538207!16s%2Fg%2F11gghd66xk)) which was very convenient for getting all over the city; Akihabara (at the [JR-East Hotel Mets Akihabara](https://www.google.com/maps/place/JR-East+Hotel+Mets+Akihabara/@35.6981377,139.7720005,19z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m9!3m8!1s0x60188db09bb3676f:0x48bb715b1f5acee2!5m2!4m1!1i2!8m2!3d35.6981366!4d139.7726442!16s%2Fg%2F11h1y61mm6), directly above the train station, which was *so* convenient, and surprisingly spacious and inexpensive); and our first night at a very small hotel in Shibuya which was a bit far but a lovely neighborhood ambiance for my introduction to Japan.

If you fly into Narita International Airport, you may see signs as you're waiting in the interminable passport control line to tell you to pre-purchase your [Narita Express](https://www.jreast.co.jp/multi/en/nex/) train ticket. Don't do it! Prepurchasing just meant that I had to wait in an incredibly long line to pick up the ticket; it would have been much faster to just purchase directly at the ticket vending machines.
