![my headshot]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/DWeinzimmer_headshot_300x300.jpg){: .align-left} Hi, I‚Äôm David. I‚Äôm a full-stack software engineer. My primary web development experience is in full-stack PHP, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL).

My prior professional experience is in transportation planning, consulting, and project management, both within government and in the private sector. I have masters degrees in Transportation Engineering (M.S.) and City Planning (M.C.P.) from the University of California, Berkeley. Go Bears! üêª I‚Äôm enthusiastic about using civic innovation to improve public service delivery.

When I‚Äôm not thinking about technology or transportation, I also enjoy food, reading, learning languages, sewing, and getting outside on my two feet or a bike! üö≤

### Projects I‚Äôve Worked On in Transportation and Public Services

- I conducted a comprehensive review of the key drivers of [elder abuse case complexity](http://sfcontroller.org/sites/default/files/Documents/Auditing/APS%20Staffing%20Analysis%20Final%20Report%205-18-17.pdf) in San Francisco, analyzing over 21,000 case records in Stata and performing a survey of peer jurisdictions (conference slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1IGRRmg2EHgofY7R0BJZviDfww_KLhOksBbdg8U0NQQs/edit#slide=id.g1e43e14893_0_137))
- I created and maintained the original transportation pages on the [San Francisco City Scorecards](http://sfgov.org/scorecards/) website
- I worked with a team to [improve staff processes and customer experience around Muni-related feedback](http://sfcontroller.org/sites/default/files/Documents/Auditing/MCS%20Lean%20RIE%20one-pager%20FINAL.pdf) through data analysis, business process mapping, customer & peer surveys, and lean process improvement
- I designed and implemented a [study of the immediate impacts of implementing bus rapid transit on the Bx41 route](/assets/pdfs/SBS-Bx41-Study-Final-Public.pdf) in the Bronx, including statistically modeling the dwell time of NYC Transit buses serving bus stops

### Some books I've enjoyed

Because why not.
- [Sister, Outsider](https://bookshop.org/books/sister-outsider-essays-and-speeches-9780143134442/9781580911863) by Audre Lorde, an incredible collection of essays.
- [The Price of Salt](https://bookshop.org/books/the-price-of-salt-or-carol/9780486800295) by Patricia Highsmith, a stunningly beautiful novel that became the film <i>Carol</i>.
- [How We Fight For Our Lives](https://bookshop.org/books/how-we-fight-for-our-lives-a-memoir-2296de7f-771a-406c-9c47-f5c6a0f0a8b9/9781501132742) by Saeed Jones, I could not stop talking about this memoir.
- [Giovanni‚Äôs Room](https://bookshop.org/books/giovanni-s-room-9780792796107/9780345806567) by James Baldwin is from a similar era as <i>The Price of Salt</i> (1956 and 1952 respectively); I couldn‚Äôt believe it was written then. Beautiful and moving.
- [How to Be an Antiracist](https://bookshop.org/books/how-to-be-an-antiracist/9780525509288) by Ibram X. Kendi was an important starting point for me on better understanding and committing to being antiracist
- [Big Little Lies](https://bookshop.org/books/big-little-lies/9780425274866) by Liane Moriarty despite being a pretty big book was a page turner the whole way through for me.
- [The Great Believers](https://bookshop.org/books/the-great-believers/9780735223530) by Rebecca Makai was a book I was so sad to finish because I wanted more time with these characters.
